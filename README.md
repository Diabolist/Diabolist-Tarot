# DIABOLIST TAROT
A simple Python program to get randomly generated single-card, Yes/No Tarot readings.

The program "shuffles" the deck by using the random function to draw randomly, and additionally supports both Upright and Reversed cards.


# USAGE

Download the Python file

Ensure Python is installed

Open Terminal or Command Prompt depending on your operating system and cd to the directory you downloaded the Python file

Type Python Diabolist-Tarot.py (if you renamed the file use the new filename)

The program will open, type your question, press enter, and repeat ad infinitum until satisfied, then type 'exit' to exit or use a keyboard interrupt.

# EXTRA

The program uses basic, simple Tarot interpretations (https://backyardbanshee.com/tarot/card-meanings/minor-arcana/knight-of-pentacles-coins-disks/) to fit the Yes/No feature, for more detailed interpretations you can use the linked site and do your own research, this can be used for a lot more than Yes/No readings, if you are willing to research a cards interpretation.

When reading Tarot, you should keep a clear question and try keep emotions out of it, if you are inexperienced Tarot should be used as a secondary form of divination. Tarot reading can be seen as a way to connect to your "higher self" or "spirit guides", and so keeping a clear and calm mind when using it will help users connect better and thus get more effective readings.
